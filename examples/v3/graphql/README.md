# GraphQL + Pact

Demonstrates how to do Pact testing against a GraphQL endpoint. This is a POC, demonstrating how PactJS could provide a simple helper function that wraps the GraphQL request into a basic Interaction suitable for Pact (after all, GraphQL is simply an interface over HTTP).

Test it out here:

```
npm run test:consumer
npm run test:provider
```
