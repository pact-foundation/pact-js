#WIP - DO NOT USE

Implementation of the consumer driven contract library [pact](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-specification).

From the [Pact website](http://docs.pact.io/):

>The Pact family of frameworks provide support for [Consumer Driven Contracts](http://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html) testing.

>A Contract is a collection of agreements between a client (Consumer) and an API (Provider) that describes the interactions that can take place between them.

>Consumer Driven Contracts is a pattern that drives the development of the Provider from its Consumers point of view.

>Pact is a testing tool that guarantees those Contracts are satisfied.
