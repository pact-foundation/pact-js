Thank you for making a pull request!

Pact-JS is built and maintained by developers like you, and we appreciate contributions very much. You are awesome!

Our changelog is automatically built from our commit history, using conventional changelog. This means we'd like to take care that:

- commit messages with the prefix `fix:` or `fix(foo):` are suitable to be added to the changelog under "Fixes and improvements"
- commit messages with the prefix `feat:` or `feat(foo):` are suitable to be added to the changelog under "New features"

If you've made many commits that don't adhere to this style, we recommend squashing 
your commits to a new branch before making a PR. Alternatively, we can do a squash
merge, but you'll lose attribution for your change.

For more information please see CONTRIBUTING.md
