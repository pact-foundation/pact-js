## GraphQL API

GraphQL is simply an abstraction over HTTP and may be tested via Pact.

### API

There are two wrapper APIs available for GraphQL specific testing: `GraphQLInteraction` and `ApolloGraphQLInteraction` that can be used as a drop-in replacement for the `addInteraction` method.

These are both lightweight wrappers over the standard DSL in order to make GraphQL testing a bit nicer.
